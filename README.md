# R-Ladies Wine Preferences: Sip and Code Recap and Tutorial (Summer 2019)

This is a blog post I originally wrote for the R-Ladies Chicago blog with some data visualizations I did during the meetup. 

You can read it at the [R-Ladies Chicago site](https://rladieschicago.org/post/2019_07_01_block/) and also take a look at what the ladies have been up to.
